It wasn't too long ago when {name} found {ref} in a sticky situation. Quite literally, actually. {subj} {was_were} trying to open a bottle of honey, when all of a sudden, {subj} lost {posad} grip on the bottle and the honey squirted all over those wonderful clothes of {pos} and the rest of {ref}!
My friend {name} has been a little sad lately. {subj} lost {posad} notebook, and {is_are} feeling disappointed in {ref}, so I decided to try and cheer {obj} up alongside another friend of {pos}. The two of us baked a cake and bought a brand new notebook for {obj}, we're giving it to {obj} tomorrow!
{name} was feeling very proud of {ref}- {subj} had just finished {posad} homework! Now there was nothing between {obj} and those games {subj} bought last weekend.
{name} looked {ref} over in the mirror. {subj} thought {subj} looked pretty great in this costume, and {subj} had even made it {ref}. The mask was {posad} favorite part. {subj} {was_were} going to have so much fun with {posad} friends at the costume party!
Have you met my friend {name}? {subj} {is_are} pretty cool! That's {obj} over there, see {posad} bright purple shirt? {subj} {is_are} in my D&D group since we were little and we always have fun with {obj}. {subj} once fought off two ice dragons all by {ref} with those rad magic spells of {pos}.
